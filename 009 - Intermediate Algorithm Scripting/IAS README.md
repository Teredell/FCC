Lesson 1: Instead of using Math.min() & Math.max() to find the highest and lowest i used a sort. But answer achieved nonetheless.

Lesson 2: This one looked simple but was actually difficult, even after the hints. I have now spent considerable time reading the possible solutions to understand what they do and gone with the one whicxh makes the most sense. More practice indeed.

Lesson 3: I beat the challenge & 1 of the solutions allowed for adding to the arguements in the function creation, so it s awin. However 2 of the soltuions used: var valsToRemove = Array.from(arguments).slice(1); which i've never seen before to get the other args out without changing it. So does this now mean the amount of arguments i put into a function is now void? silly!
