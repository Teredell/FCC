Lesson 1: Instead of using Math.min() & Math.max() to find the highest and lowest i used a sort. But answer achieved nonetheless.

Lesson 2: This one looked simple but was actually difficult, even after the hints. I have now spent considerable time reading the possible solutions to understand what they do and gone with the one whicxh makes the most sense. More practice indeed.

Lesson 3: I beat the challenge & 1 of the solutions allowed for adding to the arguements in the function creation, so it s awin. However 2 of the soltuions used: var valsToRemove = Array.from(arguments).slice(1); which i've never seen before to get the other args out without changing it. So does this now mean the amount of arguments i put into a function is now void? silly!

Lesson 4: I fucked around as much as i could and couldn't get it, am feeling a bit failed. The solutiuon that made the most sense i have used... but fuck idk.

Lesson 5: I was feeling really bad about yesterdays apparent failure in learning to code. Today i defiantly checked in and made this code. It's not nearly the same as all the other answers but it works!

Lesson 6: Still feeling a bit out of place & my answers aren't the same as the help today - but the code achieves the result! My codee is a bit of a mash of some of the answers

Lesson 7: I really thought about putting a switch case in, one of the answers did! Anyway mine is again an amalgam of the provided answers and works.

Lesson 8: And then lo & behold the next exercise a switch was ideal haha - compared to lesson 4 this was easy? 

Lesson 9: Looks like the help answers are way over-complicated. My solution almost looks too simple, but it passes!
