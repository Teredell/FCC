# FCC
FCC is Going to become a training ground for my journey through FreeCodeCamp
I've already completed HTML & CSS
Opening a Github at the start of my Javascript learning

25/5/20
I realize having a github account going seems like a good career move.
I haven't been updating it with lessons as planned but my JS journey has begun.

Having like 3 places my code is stored seems like hard work.
I complete the lessons on FreeCodeCamp
I re-do them on codepen.io in a slightly altered fashion so they display
and then having to copy/paste them here, which I've neglected.
There must be a better more efficient way.

I have now figured out how to make JS "run" in Microsoft visual code!
In addition I have figured out how to connect it thru github desktop to automagically update the repositiories.
Lots of googling but now I'll slowly add all those lessons over.
Extra practice is good though.

I now have JS running on sublime text on my home Linux mint machine and github desktop on there also.
Continuing to work through the lessons and catchup to where I am up to on FCC

I'm starting to reach that point where things aren't simple all the time, which is good!
I'm moving forward slowly with the new concepts and going back over the easy ones catching up with my current position on FCC.
Repitition is key.

Work has been really busy of late, some days I'm only getting in like 10 mins of practice.
Additionally I'm going to spend more time practicing some of these more difficult concepts to fully understand them.

11/7/20
Individual README's have been added to each folder as a bit of a place for review.

29/4/21
My current workplace made sweeping I.T changes some time ago which has meant I can no longer use VS code and several other applications on my work computer.
I am now limited to learning either at home after a long day or in browser only.
The last few days I have been revising over the JS lessons in FCC to get back to where I was.
It doesn't feel like I'm making progress on FCC as you only get a "point" or streak day for lessons you have not alrerady completed.
I figure adding a commit to this file each day I do some practice will serve that feeling of progress.

21/06/21
Lost a bit of the streak there due to interstate visitations but have been going strong since.
I've re-completed basic JS & REGEX, I'm going to skip over ES6 for now, i recall this being quite the hurdle. 
I think I'll get through debugging and then come back to it, before moving onto basic data structures, where i'll start earning streak days again.
I've found a site call replit.com and while i haven't integrated with github yet it's good to have an IDE available at work.

22/06/21
Didn't think I'd be adding a new entry so soon, but I was right kind of yesterday.
lesson 5 of debugging has an arrow function so I'll go to ES6 as soon as i'm done.

24/06/21
About to re-start ES6 (with some trepidation) but there were several lessons already exisiting with some notes.
I've re-named these lessons (why delete them, they have some notes) & had a scan of the notes.
I'll re-read each lessons notes on the old ones as i go through and re-complete the ES6 lessons as I go.
Hopefully ES6 makes more sense this time round as but most important, i have to stick with it!

27/06/21
Small congratulatory note to self, just passed lesson where I seemingly gave up last year.

02/07/21
Finished ES6

06/07/21
The note on 27/06/21 is where i gave up adding new lessons to github on my last revision of ES6, but it would seem i had finished it prior on FCC. NOW I have gone past that, i have completed all lessons i had previously done on FCC in total and am now breaking new ground.
