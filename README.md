# FCC
FCC is Going to become a training ground for my journey through FreeCodeCamp
I've already completed HTML & CSS
Opening a Github at the start of my Javascript learning

I realize having a github account going seems like a good career move.
I haven't been updating it with lessons as planned but my JS journey has begun.

Having like 3 places my code is stored seems like hard work.
I complete the lessons on FreeCodeCamp
I re-do them on codepen.io in a slightly altered fashion so they display
and then having to copy/paste them here, which i've neglected.
There must be a better more efficient way.

I have now figured out how to make JS "run" in Microsoft visual code!
In addition I have figured out how to connect it thru github desktop to automagically update the repositiories.
Lots of googling but now i'll slowly add all those lessons over.
Extra practice is good though.

I now have JS running on sublime text on my home Linux mint machine and github desktop on there also.
Continuing to work through the lessons and catchup to where I am up to on FCC

I'm starting to reach that point where things aren't simple all the time, which is good!
I'm moving forward slowly with the new concepts and going back over the easy ones catching up with my current position on FCC.
Repitition is key.
