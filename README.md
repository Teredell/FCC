# FCC
FCC is Going to become a training ground for my journey through FreeCodeCamp
I've already completed HTML & CSS
Opening a Github at the start of my Javascript learning

25/5/20
I realize having a github account going seems like a good career move.
I haven't been updating it with lessons as planned but my JS journey has begun.

Having like 3 places my code is stored seems like hard work.
I complete the lessons on FreeCodeCamp
I re-do them on codepen.io in a slightly altered fashion so they display
and then having to copy/paste them here, which i've neglected.
There must be a better more efficient way.
