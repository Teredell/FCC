Lesson 1: Creating an array, lesson notes arrays can be multi-dimensional. But this lesson is just one.

Lesson 2: Altering and accessing an array with bracket notation.

Lesson 3: Using push & unshift to add elements to arrays.

Lesson 4: Using pop & shift to remove elements of arrays. These can be assigned to a variable on removal.

Lesson 5: Remove multiple items from any location in array using splice. NB this could have been done with 1 splice I just didn't figure it out.

Lesson 6: Adding items with splice. you can use splice to remove and add at the same time (or not remove any at all)

Lesson 7: Introduced slice() (not sPlice), where we copy parts of an array into a new array.

Lesson 8: Spread operator to copy one array out into another array is used. looks like this someArr = [...arr];

Lesson 9: Can use spread operator in the middle of another array.

Lesson 10: One can use the indexOf() method to check if an element is present in an array.

Lesson 11: Using a for loop to iterate through an array, also using the indexOf method.

Lesson 12: Creating & accessing mutli-level arrays.

Lesson 13: Moving on to objects now! objects with key/value pairs. This lesson demonstrates the 3 ways one can add new properties (or key/values) to an object. I need to be careful with terminology here.

Lesson 14: Accessing and modifying nested objects with dot notation.

Lesson 15: Accessing objects with variables / bracket notation - if key is unknown a variable can be used.

Lesson 16: What is says on the box, how to delete properties of an object.

Lesson 17: Checking if an object has a property, previously i used the hasOwnProperty() method, this exercise introduced the 'in' method, which is cool.

Lesson 18: Using the (for .. in ) loop for objects.

Lesson 19: This one looks VERY useful - use the Object.keys() to return an array of all keys in an object. Note the capitalized O in Object.

Lesson 20: I honestly thought the last exercise would have been harder or some sort or test..... maybe i'm getting better at this?? Used the .push() method to add onto an array stored in an object.
