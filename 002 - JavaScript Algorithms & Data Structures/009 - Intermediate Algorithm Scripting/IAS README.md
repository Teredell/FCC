Lesson 1: Instead of using Math.min() & Math.max() to find the highest and lowest I used a sort. But answer achieved nonetheless.

Lesson 2: This one looked simple but was actually difficult, even after the hints. I have now spent considerable time reading the possible solutions to understand what they do and gone with the one which makes the most sense. More practice indeed.

Lesson 3: I beat the challenge & 1 of the solutions allowed for adding to the arguements in the function creation, so it's a win. However 2 of the solutions used: var valsToRemove = Array.from(arguments).slice(1); which I've never seen before to get the other args out without changing it. So does this now mean the amount of arguments I put into a function is now void? silly!

Lesson 4: I fucked around as much as possible and couldn't get it, am feeling a bit failed. The solutiuon that made the most sense I have used... but fuck idk.

Lesson 5: I was feeling really bad about yesterdays apparent failure in learning to code. Today I defiantly checked in and made this code. It's not nearly the same as all the other answers but it works!

Lesson 6: Still feeling a bit out of place & my answers aren't the same as the help today - but the code achieves the result! My code is a bit of a mash of some of the answers.

Lesson 7: I really thought about putting a switch case in, one of the answers did! Anyway mine is again an amalgam of the provided answers and works.

Lesson 8: And then lo & behold the next exercise a switch was ideal haha - compared to lesson 4 this was easy? 

Lesson 9: Looks like the help answers are way over-complicated. My solution almost looks too simple, but it passes!

Lesson 10: so arguments is a keyword that literally replaces accessing the input parameters name. I really don't recall this being covered. I solved without revealing the answers. Only to find some of the answers actually changed the input parameter arr to ...arr, which I didnt know was allowed. I did google a fair bit but I got there and my solutiuon is almost verbatum answer 2.
Sidenote - putting comments with ideas of how I'm going to tackle one of these in parts seems to help.

Lesson 11: relatively simple switch and build an array and join to a string. Other more terse solutions existed but this was basically one of them.

Lesson 12: Too busy at work with 2 missing from ofice, finally got back into this 2 days later! Seemed to get over inital confusion relatively quickly. Once I figured out how to make a Fibonacci sequence I was away, other soltutions a little different but mine works too. Also first practical use of a do...while loop.

Lesson 13: This one really fucked with my head and I'm giving up today after a few hours of testing and reviewing diferent solutions and referring to the help even modifiying the help solution with some console.logs changed the outcome today WTF. I understand what's going on but why it won't replicate in my code is fucking beyond me today.

Lesson 14: So I have had super busy week at work and I didn't have the capacity to answer this question without undivided attention. Even moreso that on Saturday when I completed this, I'd been thinking about and reading into the Euclidian algo's for a few days and had an idea of how to do this in my head. I have felt dumb, but this is a new level of dumb. Do i get it, yes but wow it took alot of work!
Ulitmately when I'm done with this section I need to find some practice example that force me to get comfortable with algos and reduce if im going to run into these alot more.

Lesson 15: AFter many days of feeling dumb, it's not alot better today - I just couldn't seem to crack this easy one without a bit of a push from the help. Changing arr[i] to arr[0] makes sense now, because everytime you .shift() arr[0] does change.

Lesson 16: Are you looking at recursion again? you need to go back to the function you ARE MAKING! not some internal loop. In other news, still dumb, still not getting recursion and things.

Lesson 17: I needed to do this one, as I knew I could do it without looking at the answer - yes my answer is a little longer than the solutions but I did it without looking ahead. Split string to array, convert to binary, convert to alphanumeric, re-join string.

Lesson 18: Ok, some more confidence. Although on checking the answer it would seem I should have also have been checking for the existance of the variable in the array of objects, but it passed without this. I could have done that no worries if I was instructed to.

Lesson 19: Encountered a function with 2 sets of parentheses to deal with, in googling how to do this I stumbled onto part of the answer. Even so figuring out how to implement was a good challenge and got it done. Reading solutions I think mine covers more edge cases instead of taking only 1 or 2 inputs

Lesson 20: A little dissappointed that my answer was absolutely fine and passed all the tests yet not accepted by FCC. Been a while since I did getters / setters for objects, but a nice change from all the heady algorithms!

Lesson 21: This one was cool! and for all intents and purposes I figured it out on my own. There were some methods in the possible answsers where I could be more terse with the end array, but mine will do! Nice to go out on what feels like a win in an otherwise very hard set of lessons. Create an algo from wiki and return array of objects.
