Lesson 1: Apply basic (BIMDAS) mathematical formula to one number to return another. C to F.

Lesson 2: Reverse a string. The exercise suggested i needed to turn it into an array which lead to my long *convulted* answer, but it got it done & i learnt about .join() in the process. FCC answer included but did not use an array as suggested by the exercise?

Lesson 3: I'll have to take a break here as i attempted several things with no luck - eventually looked at the answer. It makes sense and i tried *= and* it didn't work for some reason. I also should again practice recusion, but this works.

Lesson 4: Some exercises like number 3 make me feel dumb but then I do this one and i get it exactly right with no help. Although i did have to google the split() method but it was exactly what was in the answer.
