Have renamed my 2020 attempt at ES6 to OLD_Lesson-xxx
I've also blown away the no notes taken in this readme.
I'm still using the README in each section for notes about what each section teaches me, this will be no different.

lesson 1: mostly that using let over var will catch re-use errors
lesson 2: also that using let instead of var will cause the variable to have local scope rather than global which can cause issues.
(honestly, i'll use let, but people just need to use different variable names i think)
