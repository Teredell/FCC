Lesson 1 - Must have this script at the top with document ready so page fully loads/renders before running JS.

Lesson 2 - Ok, after learning a bit more about adding jQuery and CSS animations to a site so my examples will work in VS Code, I have been able to progress.

Lesson 3 - Easy now that everything in lesson 2 has been worked out.

Lesson 4 - I think the last 2 lessons and this one are just showing ways you can pick an element is the point. So use, by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn") or by id: $("#target1")

Lesson 5 - Delete lines, waste of time.

Lesson 6 - Practice above lesson 4.

Lesson 7 - Because the document ready loads all the HTML first I guess that's why this removeClass function works. But yes you can declare it in the html and remove it in the jQuery.

Lesson 8 - You can change CSS using jQuery using the .css() method. You have to comma seperate value to do so.

Lesson 9 - You can disable (and probably do other stuff) non-CSS elements using the .prop() method. As above it's comma seperated.

Lesson 10 - Can also basically override HTML by using .html() method to do stuff like add tags and change text shown in this example.

Lesson 11 - You can also completely remove a HTML element using .remove()

Lesson 12 - You can MOVE elements from one div to another using the .append() function.

Lesson 13 - You can also chain function, like in JS. So chaining together .clone().appendTo() has the effect of COPYING one element instead of moving.

Lesson 14 - You can access the parent of the element you selected using the .parent() function.

Lesson 15 - And the reverse is also true, you can access the children elements using .children()

Lesson 16 - This one will require a little practice, but you can access the nth child of an element or type and do stuff to it.

Lesson 17 - Also can select with some practice even or odd number of elements using this technique.

Lesson 18 - You can apply things to the whole webpage using body too. Also the animated hinge was pretty cool
