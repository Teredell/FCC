Lesson 1 - must haver this script at the top with doscument ready so page fully loads/renders before running JS

Lesson 2 - Ok, after learning a bit more about adding jQuery and css animations to a site so my examples will work in VS Code, I have been able to progress.

Lesson 3 - Easy now that everthing in lesson 2 has been worked out.

Lesson 4 - I think the last 2 lessons and this one are just showing ways you can pick an element is the point. so use, by type: $("button"), by class: $(".btn") or by id: $("#target1")

Lesson 5 - Delete lines, waste of time.

Lesson 6 - Practice above lesson 4

Lesson 7 - Because the document ready loads all the HTML first i guess that's why this removeClass function works. But yes you can declare it in the html and remove it in the jQuery.

Lesson 8 - you can change css using jQuery using the .css() method. you have to comma seperate value to do so

Lesson 9 - You can disable (and probaby do other stuff) non-css elements using the .prop() method. as above it's comma seperated

Lesson 10 - Can also basically override HTML by using .html() method to do stuff like add tages and change text shown in this example

Lesson 11 - You can also completely remove a HTML element using .remove()

Lesson 12 - You can MOVE elements from one div to another using the .append() function

Lesson 13 - you can also chain function, like in JS. so chaining together .clone().appendTo() has the effect of COPYING one element instead of moving

Lesson 14 - You can access the parent of the element you selected using the .parent() function

Lesson 15 - And the reverse is also tru, you can access the children elements usingt .children()

Lesson 16 - This one will require a little practice, but you can access the nth child of an element or type and do stuff to it.

Lesson 17 - Also can select with some practice even or odd number of elements using this technique

Lesson 18 - You can apply things to the whole webpage using body too. Also the animated hinge was pretty cool
