This section on FCC is about debugging.

Some techniques that are useful in debugging are;
Logging variables to the console i.e. console.log(myVariable);
Checking the type of the variable i.e. console.log(typeof myVariable);

Some common coding mistakes to catch when your code isn't working so far are;
Checking for spelling mistakes - variables, functions etc need to match
Checking for all opening brackets, parentheses, quotes & braces having closing ones too
Checking for mixed usage of quotes vs double quotes
Checking for assignment operator (=) vs equality operator (== / ===)
Missing () after function call
Arguements being passed in wrong order to functions (unexpected results if type is correct too)
OBOE errors = off by one error with indexing. Check index start and finish remember 0
Checking where variable initalized with loops
Check for inifinity loops! must have valid terminating condition
