17/05/21 - Lesson 89 - Spent some time today between a mountain of work looking at this record problem. I may need to do this one with focused time. but i did make a little headway
18/05/21 - Lesson 89 - managed to pass it today!

24/05/21 - Lesson 97 Completed recursion exercise
28/05/21 - Profile lookup completed. Some errors with code but logic understood. repeated several times.



Note: 11/5/21 - Very impressed with myself for getting card counting right on first attempt. I recall this being difficult.
Note: 13/5/21 - Need to be sure about when to use dot and bracket notation (lesson: Testing Objects for Properties). I have passed the lesson but checking this is a good plan.
Note: 14/5/21 - Started looking at record collection, but i'm not in a space at work where i have the capacity to complete it.
Note: 18/05/21 - I need to be more careful with [] & () on the .hasOwnProperty useage this was basically what was causing me to fail. I understand though. i need to use ()
and if i want to test for a string "" and variable no "" - don't use []. <--- thats probs not grammatically correct but i've been on my own all day in the office with no help
and still managed to do a little coding.
Note: 24/05/21 - I have gone and done a bit of a readup on my previous efforts with recursion, i was never comfortable with it but i understand as much as i did last time
Note: 28/05/21 - Last few days have been hectic but i am determined to continue with this!
