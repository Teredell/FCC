Lesson 1: Create a basic JS object

Lesson 2: Access object properties with dot notation

Lesson 3: Create a method within the object

Lesson 4: Introduces the "this" method. In a method within the object use the term this, that way if the name of the object changes the method still works - Other uses for "this" exist, this is only 1 thing.

Lesson 5: Make a constructor function. So you can make multiple objects easily.

Lesson 6: Use the new keyword and the function created in lesson 5 to make a new object.

Lesson 7: Make to function able to recieve arguements so as each diferent instance of the object can be changed at initailization.

Lesson 8: there is a method called instanceOf, you can check if an object was created from an constructor or not.

Lesson 9: Seems a little redundant but understanding that each object has its own properties. created a for in loop to export them to an array.

Lesson 10: Introduces the prototype methodology, i like this. So you can establish a property  (that is changeable) for all objects created with it.

Lesson 11: Lesson 9 seems a little less redundant now, as there are different types of properties. own properties and prototype properties. (where prototype ones are made for all, just reiterating).

Lesson 12: In addition to lesson 8, which is better to use, wee can also check if an object has been made using the .constructor method which will return true or false.
