//Lesson 002 - Understanding the Differences between the freeCodeCamp and Browser Console

// Open your browser console.
let output = "Get this to log once in the freeCodeCamp console and twice in the browser console";
// Use console.log() to print the output variable.
console.clear(); //This line was added
console.log(output); //The output variable was inserted into the statement.

// Run the tests to see the difference between the two consoles.

// Now, add console.clear() before your console.log() to clear the browser console, and pass the tests.
