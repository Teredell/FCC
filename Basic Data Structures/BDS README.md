Lesson 1: Creating an array, lesson notes arrays can be multi-dimensional. But this lesson just one.

Lesson 2: Altering and accessing an array with bracket notation.

Lesson 3: Using push & unshift to add elements to arrays.

Lesson 4: Using pop & shift to remove elements of arrays. These can be assigned to variable on removal.

Lesson 5: Remove multiple items from any location in array using splice. NB this could have been done with 1 splice i just didn't figure it out.

Lesson 6: Adding items with splice. you can use splice to remove and add at the same time (or not remove any at all)

Lesson 7: Introduced slice() (not sPlice), where we copy parts of an array into a new array.

Lesson 8: Spread operator to copy one array out into another array is used. looks like this someArr = [...arr];

Lesson 9: can use spread operator in the middle of another array.

Lesson 10: One can use the indexOf() method to check if an element is present in an array.

Lesson 11: using a for loop to iterate through an array, also using the indexOf method.

Lesson 12: creating & accessing mutli-level arrays.

Lesson 13: Moving on to objects now! onbjects with key/value pairs. This lesson demonstares the 3 ways one can add new properties (or key/values) to an object. I need to be careful with terminology here.

Lesson 14: Accessing and modifying nested objects with dot notation.

Lesson 15: Accessing objects with variables / bracket notation - if key is unknown a vaiable can be used.

Lesson 16: What is says on the box, how to delete properties of an object.

Lesson 17: Checking if an object has a property, previously i used the hasOwnProperty() method, this exercise introduced the 'in' method, which is cool.

Lesson 18: Using the (for .. in ) loop for objects.
