Lesson 1: Apply basic (BIMDAS) mathematical formula to one number to return another. C to F.

Lesson 2: Reverse a string. The exercise suggested i needed to turn it into an array which lead to my long *convulted* answer, but it got it done & i learnt about .join() in the process. FCC answer included but did not use an array as suggested by the exercise?

Lesson 3: I'll have to take a break here as i attempted several things with no luck - eventually looked at the answer. It makes sense and i tried *= and* it didn't work for some reason. I also should again practice recusion, but this works.

Lesson 4: Some exercises like number 3 make me feel dumb but then I do this one and i get it exactly right with no help. Although i did have to google the split() method but it was exactly what was in the answer.

Lesson 5: I didn't read the question properly and came up with a solution to the wrong problem, after re-reading i got there.

Lesson 6: Another exercise where i kind of went the wrong way - i wanted to solve with REGEX and had to learna new method to do so, wet back and solved with slice method as required for greater understandinf

Lesson 7: Similar to lesson 4 in that i feel achieved by solving easily. my solution very close to the provided one.

Lesson 8: Truncating a string, breezed through it as above which is nice, but i noticed on the answer that i seem to be doing my if statements backwards.

Lesson 9: The exercise asks for "Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'. This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined."
I solved it without looking at the solution and my answer is basically it, just need to get more comfortable with => functions. I knew what was going on but need to see it /  do it more.

Lesson 10: I knew using the === comparison would check if these different items evaluated to a boolean but the solution was after me to use the typeof so i put both solutions in my lesson.

Lesson 11: Right out of the gate i'll say that some of these methods weren't introduced and I am having to learn them to solve the puzzle, which is fine but it leaves me feeling dumber at the start because i'm presented with a challenge I haven't learnt the knowledge to pass it.
So I leanred about .join, .split, .charAt & .replace.
There were other methodologies to solve this but this is the one i arrived at which is a bit of a hybrid of the others found in the solutions.

Lesson 12: This one was better explained and i had the knowledge. I do need to stop doing newArr = arr1 and use newArr = arr1.slice(); for copying arrays.
Also learned that i can't splice in an array i have to loop thru the elements from an array and insert them.

Lesson 13: There is a difference between === true and checking for truthy. After correcting this difference it all works.

Lesson 14: Basically i nailed this one, and did the googling first to use the .sort(compare) method. My answer same as answer 1 in the help, there were several others available.

lesson 15: I think i try to go for REGEX too often, becuase i keep thinking its going to come up. It's later in the day today and while i can code the solution i need to re-read it a few times more to let it sink in properly.

Lesson 16: I played with many methods to get this done, in the end my method was good just needed to use slice and i would have had it.
